# Symbiote

A [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft that gives every player on the server **one shared inventory**. Storage and hotbar are always shared; armor and offhand can be too. Pick something up as one player, and it's instantly available to the rest of the party.

## Features

- **One inventory for everyone** — the 36 main/hotbar slots are backed by a single shared storage, so any item any player picks up is visible and usable by the whole server immediately.
- **Optional sharing for armor and offhand** — each can be toggled independently in the settings (see below). Main storage and hotbar are always shared; these two are opt-in. The crafting grid is never shared — it stays personal to each player.
- **Independent aim, shared gear** — each player keeps their own selected hotbar slot, so two players can hold two different (shared) items at once.
- **Optional hotbar slot ownership** (on by default) — whichever hotbar slot a player currently has selected is exclusively "theirs" until they switch off it. Nobody else can take from, place into, or otherwise touch that slot — not by clicking it directly, shift-clicking something onto it, pressing a number key while hovering another slot, swapping hands, or dropping — and nobody else can select it themselves either: pressing its number key does nothing, and scrolling past it jumps straight over to the next free slot in that direction instead of landing on it or getting stuck. Enabling this caps a server (or, with teams on, each team) at **9 players** (one per hotbar slot); the 10th+ connection, or team join, is rejected with a clear reason.
- **Colors match the locator bar** — each player's lock-frame color is computed from their UUID the exact same way vanilla's locator bar dots are, so the same player is always the same color in both places, server-wide, with no extra networking needed.
- **Optional shared health, hunger, and/or XP** — three independent toggles. With shared health on, every online player's health moves together (damage, healing, regen, everything) as one pool; if it hits 0, everyone dies at once, and the shared inventory is dropped and emptied for the whole server (once, not once per player). With shared hunger on, food level and saturation move together the same way. With shared XP on, experience level and progress move together too — level up mining, and your teammates level up with you. Any combination can be on at once.
- **Funny propagated-death messages** — when the shared health pool hits 0, whoever's own damage actually emptied it dies normally, but everyone else on the team who goes down purely because the pool did gets a random joke death message instead (a large pool of short, blunt one-liners, each in a random chat color), since nothing actually hit them.
- **Low-health screen warning** — a red tint (with a rotating joke caption) that ramps up as your own health drops below 3 hearts. Purely client-local and cosmetic — it never affects gameplay — and can be switched off per-player in the settings screen, independent of everyone else's preference.
- **"Request slot" ping** — press the (unbound by default) "Request Hovered Slot" key — keyboard or mouse button — while hovering someone else's locked hotbar slot in any inventory screen to send them a friendly actionbar nudge. Rate-limited per player, and only ever reaches a teammate — never a player on a different team. Works even while an inventory screen has input focus.
- **Teams** — when "Split into teams" is on (the default), sharing (inventory, equipment, hotbar ownership, health, hunger, XP, all of it) is scoped per-team instead of one pool for the whole server. Manage teams with `/symbiote team create|delete|list|join|leave|assign`. There's no separate "unassigned" team to think about — with teams on, anyone not explicitly assigned to a named team just stays in the same `global` pool everyone shares when teams are off; assign them to pull them out of it. Which teams exist and who's on them is saved and reloaded every time the server (re)starts.
- **`keepInventory` is forced on** — a shared inventory can't survive one player's death clearing it for everyone, so the mod sets the `keepInventory` game rule to `true` on server start. The one deliberate exception is a shared-health wipe (above), which empties it on purpose, exactly once.
- **Stateless by design** — every team's shared inventory lives in memory and resets every time the server starts, so it never conflicts with per-player save data.

## Settings

Settings are server-authoritative (they affect every connected player identically) and can be changed two ways:

- **In-game**: press the "Open Symbiote Settings" key (unbound by default — bind it in Controls) to open the settings screen, which now scrolls if your window is too short to show everything at once. Anyone can open it to view the current settings, but only the singleplayer host or a server operator can actually save changes — a request from anyone else is dropped server-side with a chat message telling them so. The low-health warning toggle in that same screen is the one exception — it's client-local, so anyone can change their own, and it's never sent to the server.
- **Command**: `/symbiote config` shows current settings; `/symbiote config <setting> <value>` changes one (op-only, same permission check as the screen). Settings: `syncArmor`, `syncOffhand`, `enableHotbarOwnership`, `syncHealth`, `syncHunger`, `syncExperience`, `teamsEnabled` (all booleans).

Whichever way a setting is changed, it's immediately broadcast to every connected player, so everyone's client always agrees with the server about what's shared.

Settings persist in `config/symbiote.json`. Changing `syncArmor`/`syncOffhand` takes effect for players as they (re)join; the rest take effect immediately. The low-health warning toggle persists locally in `config/symbiote-client.json` on each client.

**On a brand new install** (no `config/symbiote.json` yet), `enableHotbarOwnership` and `teamsEnabled` default on, the client-local low-health warning defaults on, and armor/offhand/health/hunger/XP sharing all default off so a fresh server doesn't surprise anyone; turn on whichever ones you want.

### Teams

`/symbiote team` (op-only, same as `/symbiote config`):

- `list` — every team and how many members are online.
- `create <name>` / `delete <name>` — the implicit `global` team (used when `teamsEnabled` is off, and for anyone not explicitly assigned elsewhere) can't be deleted.
- `join <name>` — run by a player, puts them on that team (creating it if needed).
- `leave` — run by a player, returns them to the `global` pool.
- `assign <player> <name>` — puts any player on a team from console or as another player.

Every team subcommand still works while `teamsEnabled` is off (so teams can be set up in advance), but prints a chat warning each time reminding you that sharing is still one server-wide pool until it's turned on.

Which teams exist and each player's assignment are saved to `config/symbiote-teams.json` and reloaded every time the server starts (including re-entering a singleplayer world) - unlike a team's actual contents (items, equipment, tracked health/hunger/XP), which are always empty on a fresh start, same as the old single pool always was. If hotbar ownership is also on, a team is capped at 9 online members the same way the whole server used to be.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 26.2 |
| Fabric Loader | ≥ 0.19.5 |
| Fabric API | required |
| Java | ≥ 25 |

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 26.2.
2. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for the same version.
3. Grab the latest `symbiote-*.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/IlarOrlov/symbiote-mod/releases) and drop it into your server's (or client's, for singleplayer/LAN) `mods` folder.

The mod needs to be installed on the server for multiplayer; clients need it too, to see the shared hotbar's colored lock frames and to use the settings screen.

## How it works

Every `ServerPlayer`'s `Inventory` is wired via a mixin (see `com.symbiote.mixin`) to point at their resolved `Team`'s backing item list instead of its own, so writes from one player are immediately visible to the rest of that team. Armor/offhand sharing is gated by `SymbioteConfig` and applied the same way, redirecting `PlayerEquipment`'s get/set per slot type to the player's team, resolved fresh on every call.

`TeamManager` decides which `Team` a player resolves to: with `teamsEnabled` off, everyone resolves to the same implicit `global` team regardless of any `/symbiote team` assignment on record, which is exactly the original single-server-pool behavior; with it on, a player resolves to whichever team they last joined/were assigned to, or back to `global` if never assigned one - there's deliberately no separate auto-created "default" team to keep in sync with `global`, just the one pool everyone starts in either way. Flipping `teamsEnabled`, or changing a player's assignment, re-points every affected online player's `Inventory` at the right team's item list immediately (`TeamManager#reassignInventory`) rather than waiting for a rejoin - equipment and hotbar-ownership/health/hunger/XP don't need this since they already resolve the team fresh on every call/tick. Which teams exist and who's assigned to them is persisted to `config/symbiote-teams.json` on every create/delete/assign/unassign and reloaded on every server start, rebuilding fresh (empty) `Team` instances for each persisted name so definitions survive a restart while contents don't - the same "stateless contents, persistent settings" split `SymbioteConfig` already has.

`Inventory#load` normally starts by clearing the inventory before repopulating it from the joining player's own save file - for a ServerPlayer that would wipe the *shared* list down to just whatever that one player personally had saved, on every join. `InventorySharingMixin` skips that load entirely for ServerPlayers, so a join can never clobber what everyone else already has. On join *and* on respawn (`HotbarRespawnMixin`, since a respawn hands the player a brand new `Inventory` whose selected slot is carried over from before they died), a player's selected slot is checked against every other online teammate's and moved to a free one if it collides (`HotbarOwnership#resolveSlotConflict`) - deliberately by scanning everyone's actual selected slot directly rather than reusing the broadcast-owner computation, since that computation's tie-breaking rule (a momentary two-way tie reads as "unowned" rather than picking a winner) would otherwise mask a genuine collision as "nothing to fix" and leave two players stuck sharing one slot. Either way, the player's inventory menu is also force-synced immediately so they see the shared contents right away rather than waiting for the next tick's diff.

Hotbar-slot locking has two layers. In the inventory/container GUI, `HotbarLockMixin` cancels a click outright if it's directly on a locked slot (hovering it and pressing Q, F, a number key, or clicking it) — this has to happen *before* vanilla processes it, since dropping an item or swapping to the offhand has an external side effect (a dropped entity, a written offhand slot) that reverting the slot afterward can't undo without leaving a duplicate behind. As a backstop for indirect landings vanilla picks internally (e.g. shift-clicking a stack in from a chest), the 9 hotbar slots and the cursor are also snapshotted before the click and restored if a slot locked to someone else changed anyway. Outside a GUI, selecting a slot by scrolling skips over a locked one to the next free slot in the same direction, and pressing its number key does nothing (`com.symbiote.client.mixin.HotbarScrollLockMixin`/`HotbarNumberKeyLockMixin`), with a server-side reject (`HotbarSelectionCapMixin`) as a backstop against a client that skips the check.

The gameplay-HUD lock frames (`HotbarOwnerOverlay`, via `SymbioteModClient#effectiveOwner`) predict the local player's own frame instantly from their own selected slot rather than waiting on the server broadcast, so the outline never visibly lags - but the broadcast list can still say *we* own the slot we just scrolled *away* from for that same one-round-trip window, which without correction shows our frame on both the old and new slot at once; scrolling through several slots quickly turns that into a visible trail of stale frames. Since the client already knows with certainty which slot is and isn't currently selected (no network latency involved in that), `effectiveOwner` treats any *other* slot the broadcast still credits to the local player as unowned instead of trusting that stale entry, eliminating the trail.

Health and hunger aren't a shared reference the way inventory slots are — each player's is their own synced value — so `SharedStats` instead polls once a server tick, per team: whichever online teammate's value no longer matches what was last synced to them is treated as the source of a fresh change (damage, healing, eating, or a fresh join adopting the existing pool), and that value is applied to the rest of the team. A shared-health pool reaching 0 kills every online teammate through the real death pipeline (`setHealth(0)` + `LivingEntity#die`, not `Entity#kill` - that one only force-removes the entity and never presents a respawn screen). The teammate whose own damage actually emptied the pool dies normally; everyone else on the team who goes down purely because the pool did gets a random joke death message instead (`FunnyMessages`), since nothing actually hit them. The team's shared inventory is dropped and cleared exactly once for the whole event, not once per dying player, since `keepInventory` staying forced on would otherwise just let a wipe that's supposed to end the run survive it anyway. A freshly-joined player's health can briefly read as an uninitialized `0.0` for a tick or two before Minecraft properly sets it - since that's indistinguishable from a real death by value alone, a brand new player is never treated as a change source (or even tracked at all) until their health is observed to be a real, positive number at least once. A player who's still dead and awaiting their own respawn click is tracked against their own real (still-0) health rather than whatever the pool's current value is - otherwise, the moment anyone else revives, every still-dead player's tracked baseline would silently jump to that healthy number while their actual health stays 0, and the next tick would read that mismatch as a brand new death that never happened. Shared XP (`syncExperience`) follows the exact same detection pattern as hunger, copying `experienceLevel`/`experienceProgress` directly across the team via `ServerPlayer#setExperienceLevels`/`setExperiencePoints` rather than converting through a combined "total XP" number, so a level-up shows up for teammates exactly as it happened.

The "request slot" ping is a small serverbound packet (`RequestSlotPayload`) sent when the local player presses the key while hovering (via an `@Accessor` mixin exposing `AbstractContainerScreen#hoveredSlot`) a hotbar slot in their own inventory row that the server-authoritative owner list says is locked to someone else; if hotbar ownership is off, no screen is open, or the hovered slot isn't actually locked to anyone, the client explains that locally instead of doing nothing silently. Since an open container screen can consume a key press before it reaches `KeyMapping`'s own click-tracking, the ping key is also polled by its raw physical state each tick (`InputConstants.isKeyDown` for a keyboard key, `GLFW.glfwGetMouseButton` for a mouse button, via an `@Accessor` mixin exposing `KeyMapping#key`) with its own rising-edge detection, as a backstop so it can't silently stop responding while an inventory is open, regardless of which kind of input it's bound to. The server independently re-verifies the slot really is locked to someone else on the sender's team - and separately re-checks the intended recipient really is on that same team, so a ping can never reach a player on a different one even if the owner-lookup logic changes later - enforces a per-player cooldown (`Team#lastPingTick`), and relays a random joke line to the owner's actionbar (`ServerPlayer#sendOverlayMessage`) - it never touches the slot itself. The low-health warning is entirely client-side: a `HudElement` that reads the local player's own health each frame and tints the screen (with a rotating caption from the same joke pool used elsewhere) once it drops under 3 hearts, gated by a small client-only config file that's never sent to the server.
