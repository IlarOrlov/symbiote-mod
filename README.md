# Symbiote

A [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft that gives every player on the server **one shared inventory**. Storage and hotbar are always shared; the crafting grid, armor and offhand can be too. Pick something up as one player, and it's instantly available to the rest of the party.

## Features

- **One inventory for everyone** — the 36 main/hotbar slots are backed by a single shared storage, so any item any player picks up or crafts is visible and usable by the whole server immediately.
- **Optional sharing for crafting grid, armor and offhand** — each can be toggled independently in the settings (see below). Main storage and hotbar are always shared; these three are opt-in.
- **Independent aim, shared gear** — each player keeps their own selected hotbar slot, so two players can hold two different (shared) items at once.
- **Optional hotbar slot ownership** — when enabled, whichever hotbar slot a player currently has selected is exclusively "theirs" until they switch off it. Nobody else can take from, place into, or otherwise touch that slot — not by clicking it directly, shift-clicking something onto it, pressing a number key while hovering another slot, swapping hands, or dropping — and nobody else can even select/hover it themselves via scrolling or the 1-9 keys. Enabling this caps the server at **9 players** (one per hotbar slot); the 10th+ connection is rejected with a clear reason.
- **Colors match the locator bar** — each player's lock-frame color is computed from their UUID the exact same way vanilla's locator bar dots are, so the same player is always the same color in both places, server-wide, with no extra networking needed.
- **`keepInventory` is forced on** — a shared inventory can't survive one player's death clearing it for everyone, so the mod sets the `keepInventory` game rule to `true` on server start.
- **Stateless by design** — the shared inventory lives in memory and resets every time the server starts, so it never conflicts with per-player save data.

## Settings

Settings are server-authoritative (they affect every connected player identically) and can be changed two ways:

- **In-game**: press the "Open Symbiote Settings" key (unbound by default — bind it in Controls) to open the settings screen. Anyone can open it to view the current settings, but only the singleplayer host or a server operator can actually save changes.
- **Command**: `/symbiote config` shows current settings; `/symbiote config <setting> <value>` changes one (op-only). Settings: `syncCraftingGrid`, `syncArmor`, `syncOffhand`, `enableHotbarOwnership` (all booleans).

Settings persist in `config/symbiote.json`. Changing `syncCraftingGrid`/`syncArmor`/`syncOffhand` takes effect for players as they (re)join; `enableHotbarOwnership` takes effect immediately.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 26.2 |
| Fabric Loader | ≥ 0.19.5 |
| Fabric API | required |
| Java | ≥ 25 |

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 26.2.
2. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for the same version.
3. Grab the latest `symbiote-*.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/IlarOrlov/symbiote-mod/releases) and drop it into your server's (or client's, for singleplayer/LAN) `mods` folder.

The mod needs to be installed on the server for multiplayer; clients need it too, to see the shared hotbar's colored lock frames and to use the settings screen.

## How it works

Every `ServerPlayer`'s `Inventory` is wired via a mixin (see `com.symbiote.mixin`) to point at the same backing item list instead of its own, so writes from one player are immediately visible to all. Armor/offhand sharing and the crafting-grid sharing are gated by `SymbioteConfig` and applied the same way.

Hotbar-slot locking has two layers. In the inventory/container GUI, `HotbarLockMixin` snapshots the shared hotbar (and the cursor) before every click and reverts the whole click if it touched a slot locked to a different online player — this covers every input path (click, shift-click, number-key swap while hovering, drop, swap-hands) without needing to special-case each one. Outside a GUI, selecting a slot by scrolling or pressing 1-9 is blocked client-side the moment it would land on someone else's slot (`com.symbiote.client.mixin.HotbarScrollLockMixin`/`HotbarNumberKeyLockMixin`), with a server-side reject (`HotbarSelectionCapMixin`) as a backstop against a client that skips the check.
