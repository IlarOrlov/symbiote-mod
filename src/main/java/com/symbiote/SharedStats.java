/**
 * Shares current health and/or hunger across every online member of the same
 * {@link Team}, each independently toggleable via {@link SymbioteConfig}.
 * Unlike the shared inventory (a single backing list every player's
 * {@code Inventory} points at), health and hunger aren't simple collections
 * we can alias - they're per-entity synced values - so instead this polls
 * once a server tick, per team: whichever online teammate's value no longer
 * matches what was last synced to them is treated as the source of a fresh
 * change (damage, healing, eating, a fresh join adopting the existing pool,
 * ...), and that new value is then applied to the rest of the team. The one
 * deliberate exception is a single player individually respawning while the
 * pool never actually hit 0 as a whole - vanilla always hands out full health
 * on respawn regardless of what the pool currently is, so treating that as a
 * fresh change would heal every other, already-damaged teammate back up
 * just because this one player finally respawned. That player adopts the
 * pool's current ("worst") value instead of resetting it to their own.
 *
 * <p>When {@link SymbioteConfig#syncHealth} is on, a team's shared health pool
 * reaching 0 kills every online teammate at once, through the real death
 * pipeline ({@code setHealth(0)} + {@link net.minecraft.world.entity.LivingEntity#die})
 * so respawning actually works - {@code Entity#kill} looked tempting but only
 * force-removes the entity, without ever presenting a respawn screen. The
 * teammate whose own damage actually emptied the pool dies with the normal
 * death message; everyone else on the team who goes down purely because the
 * pool did gets a random joke death message instead
 * ({@link FunnyMessages#randomPropagatedDeath}), since nothing actually hit
 * them. The team's shared inventory is dropped and cleared exactly once for
 * the whole event (not once per dying player, which would duplicate every
 * item), since {@code keepInventory} being forced on would otherwise just let
 * it survive a death that's supposed to actually end the run.
