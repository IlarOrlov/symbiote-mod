/**
 * Shares current health and/or hunger across every online player, each
 * independently toggleable via {@link SymbioteConfig}. Unlike the shared
 * inventory (a single backing list every player's {@code Inventory} points
 * at), health and hunger aren't simple collections we can alias - they're
 * per-entity synced values - so instead this polls once a server tick:
 * whichever online player's value no longer matches what we last synced them
 * to is treated as the source of a fresh change (damage, healing, eating,
 * a fresh join adopting the existing pool, ...), and that new value is then
 * applied to everyone else.
 *
 * <p>When {@link SymbioteConfig#syncHealth} is on, a shared health pool
 * reaching 0 kills every online player at once, through the real death
 * pipeline ({@code setHealth(0)} + {@link net.minecraft.world.entity.LivingEntity#die})
 * so respawning actually works - {@code Entity#kill} looked tempting but only
 * force-removes the entity, without ever presenting a respawn screen. The
 * shared inventory is dropped and cleared exactly once for the whole event
 * (not once per dying player, which would duplicate every item), since
 * {@code keepInventory} being forced on would otherwise just let it survive
 * a death that's supposed to actually end the run.
