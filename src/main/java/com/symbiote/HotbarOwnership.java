	 * one. With the {@link SymbioteConfig#HOTBAR_OWNERSHIP_PLAYER_CAP}
	 * per-team join limit in place there's always at least one free slot.
	 *
	 * <p>This deliberately scans {@code members}' own selected slots directly
	 * rather than going through {@link #currentOwners}, which would collapse
	 * a genuine two-player collision on {@code player}'s slot into "unowned"
	 * (its tie-breaking rule for a <em>momentary</em> tie while two clients'
	 * selections are mid-flight) - that would read as "no conflict, nothing
	 * to move" and leave both players stuck sharing the slot indefinitely,
	 * instead of resolving it.
	 *
	 * <p>Selecting a hotbar slot is normally entirely client-driven - the
	 * server only ever trusts whatever the client last reported. On respawn
	 * specifically, the server correctly carries the player's selected slot
	 * over from before they died ({@code Inventory#replaceWith} inside
	 * {@code ServerPlayer#restoreFrom}) - but that's a server-side copy
	 * between two entity instances that the client has no part in, so the
	 * client's <em>own</em> freshly-respawned local view of its selected slot
	 * resets to 0 independently, with no idea the server just restored a
	 * different value. Left alone, the client then reports that stale 0 back
	 * as an entirely ordinary selection-change packet: unremarkable if 0
	 * happens to be free, but if it's already someone else's, our own lock
	 * silently rejects the packet server-side while the client is never told
	 * - so it keeps believing (and rendering its own lock frame on) the slot
	 * 0 it already thinks is its, stacked right on top of the real owner's
	 * frame everyone else's broadcast correctly shows there. Always telling
	 * the client its actual resolved slot here, via {@link ForceHotbarSlotPayload},
	 * regardless of whether a conflict needed resolving, closes that gap at
	 * the source instead of only patching the cases where we ourselves moved
	 * the player.
