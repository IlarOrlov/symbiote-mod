 * Sent to a player when the server has to move their selected hotbar slot

 * collides with an online teammate's ({@link com.symbiote.HotbarOwnership#resolveSlotConflict}).
 * Selecting a hotbar slot is normally entirely client-driven (the server
 * just trusts whatever the client last reported), so without this the
 * client's own view of its selected slot would never learn about a
 * server-forced move - showing its lock frame on the slot it thinks it's
 * still on, alongside the server's (correct) broadcast of the slot it
 * actually got moved to.
