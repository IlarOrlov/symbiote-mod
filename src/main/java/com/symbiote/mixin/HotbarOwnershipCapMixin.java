/**
 * Once hotbar ownership is on, every online player permanently occupies one
 * of the 9 hotbar slots <em>of their team</em>, so a single team can't
 * usefully hold more than 9 players at a time. With teams off, the whole
 * server is one team, so this connection-time check is exactly that 9-player
 * server cap; with teams on, a team can quietly grow past 9 members here
 * (nothing at connection time knows which team a not-yet-assigned player will
 * end up on) and the real enforcement happens per-team at
 * {@code /symbiote team join}/{@code assign} time instead.
